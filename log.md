# 100 Days Of Code - Log
# This is my log of the next 100 days of code to help me become better at mainly web development
# I should also consult to my calendar to ensure that I have subjects setup for what I want to learn and plan ahead.

### Day 1: 19 November, 2018

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1h

With this hour I spent using freecodecamp to use it's responsive technologies as well as using the CSS flex system that is used inside of CSS3.

The responsive technologies, use things such as media queries to deal with certain width and height in pixels, then applying our own CSS rules.

**code snippet **
@media (max-width: 100px){
	CSS-RULES
}
**End of code snippet **

On top of using media queries I found out that images are responsive and we use (see code snippet) to deal with retina displays
otherwise we also use typography which use these to deal with responsive text vw, vh, (vwmin, vwmax need to double check these)

**code snippet**
  max-width: 100%;
  display: block;
  height: auto;
  **end of code snippet**

  Flex is very nicely used with containerising elements making it easier to manage parent and child elements together.
  You can use Flex to put elements into rows or containers which makes deciding where to put elements easier
  You can also deal with flexing elements with auto
  You can use flex's version of aligning elements inside of the container (this will override normal aligning styles)
  
**Thoughts:** I should read up on and try to remember how to deal with writing responsive technologies as well as using CSS flex to help create nicer flowing sites

### Day 0: 18 November, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Time Spent: 1h Day1: spent it learning to become better at CSS from freecodecamp, looking at applied visual design! :) Happy 100days of code start #100daysofcode #FreeCodeCamp

**Worked on**: I worked on the applied visual design today, it has shown me a way of matching colours a lot better and how you can make colours compliment each other.

**Thoughts:** I've come to realise that CSS isn't as difficult as it seems it just takes patience and messing around with values to see what fits best for your site
