### Day 0: 28/05/20

**Today's Progress**: Time Spent: 3hr

**Worked on**: Portfolio

**Thoughts:** Created my mobile responsive portfolio, looking to add some simple landing pages etc to show some of the work that I can do

Started working on a product landing page taking some inspiration on what the product is and simply trying to recreate

Overall quite happy with today's progress, used pomodoro technique to stay on top of the work that I was currently doing.

For tomorrow: get the base product landing page complete, look into setting up raspberry pi webserver with nginx.
