# 100 Days Of Code - Log
# This is my log of the next 100 days of code to help me become better at mainly web development
# I should also consult to my calendar to ensure that I have subjects setup for what I want to learn and plan ahead.

### Day 7: 25 November, 2018

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1h

Started the product landing page project, happy with the custom CSS and content that I have created so far!
More on trying to get the CSS working to how I want as I want to have the page fully responsive.

Used my understanding of CSS selectors from the Survey and this has helped me build some parts of the page a lot faster

Starting to notice my understanding for CSS a lot quicker to build things such as navbars and seperating the page

Overally happy with Sunday's work! :)
Messed around with a sticky navbar which was interesting to how it works

Need to understand, the shorthand of the CSS.

### Day 6: 24 November, 2018

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1h

Finished the page, only improvements I can think of are slight tweaks to the feel of the look aside from this the main improvements are the checkboxes and the radio buttons!

Understanding the CSS selectors better especially when it comes to narrowing down on the HTML - Same again

Have a much better understanding of margins and spacing on how to make them nice

Also implemented media queries to have the CSS change the webpage dependent on the size of the view

Need to understand how padding and spacing work better as I find them very difficult but important

### Day 5: 23 November, 2018

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1h

Continued trying to get the hang of styling this page, not getting the page the way I want it
Will try to draw out how I would like the page to look tomorrow and implement it this way as a fun exercise.

### Day 4: 22 November, 2018

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1h

Started the survey form on the free code camp page, decided to use flexbox with this form
Using lots of resources to understand what the heck is happening :) - I'm guessing this is just practice for designing

Should read up on Flexbox more again, happy with progress - going to mess around with this until I'm happy with the form being a nice looking up to date page

Used a site (see colorbook) to help gain a complementary colour with my main background color

Hopefully will get some pointers of Twitter (will put in today or tomorrow)

Flexbox design was inspired by (see design) as I thought using flex box would be a good way of understanding modern day CSS
will look into how and why they're using the selectors that they are using

Overall happy with today's practice as it was very segragated (due to irl)

### Day 3: 21 November, 2018

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1h

Updated a bit of CSS on the tribute page
Started writing the survey page, also read up on CSS tips and what's the best way to write CSS

Not too impressed with today, didn't get much done as I thought I would

Should look into what the Tweet suggestions have mentioned!

### Day 2: 20 November, 2018

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1h

Finished the CSS grid sections, further understanding how the grid system works when you have a parent element to control all of the elements including creating a grid in a grid of CSS

The CSS grid comes with ways of dealing with columns and rows and allowing for nice amounts of CSS to help structure code

Media queries can be used here to help make more responsive websites

Understanding this is very useful to creating nicely padded websites

Should look into how to design better and make better CSS now as these are fundamentals to building nice flowing websites

Also created the first code pen project and completed a basic tribute page (see code pen link) this should be done with better styling over time and will aim to make better CSS)

I'm doing this because I don't want to rely on CSS frameworks as well as dealing with all the bloat that comes with it.

**Reply's from Twitter**: 
Doublas 3D said: "View Width "vw" can be used instead of px, in, % w/CSS, like style="font-size: 5vw; padding-left: 1.25vw;" 
try justify, absolute and relative with position and think about z-index as well for styled overlap. Try many options for what works in this case may not in the next. GL"


**Thoughts** I should read up on CSS and design to make myself understand user design better for better CSS, need to practice using these techniques more as well

### Day 1: 19 November, 2018

**Today's progress**: Time spent: 1h

With this hour I spent using freecodecamp to use it's responsive technologies as well as using the CSS flex system that is used inside of CSS3.

The responsive technologies, use things such as media queries to deal with certain width and height in pixels, then applying our own CSS rules.

**code snippet**
@media (max-width: 100px){
	CSS-RULES
}
**End of code snippet *

On top of using media queries I found out that images are responsive and we use (see code snippet) to deal with retina displays
otherwise we also use typography which use these to deal with responsive text vw, vh, (vwmin, vwmax need to double check these)

**code snippet**
  max-width: 100%;
  display: block;
  height: auto;
  **end of code snippet**

  Flex is very nicely used with containerising elements making it easier to manage parent and child elements together.
  You can use Flex to put elements into rows or containers which makes deciding where to put elements easier
  You can also deal with flexing elements with auto
  You can use flex's version of aligning elements inside of the container (this will override normal aligning styles)
  
**Thoughts:** I should read up on and try to remember how to deal with writing responsive technologies as well as using CSS flex to help create nicer flowing sites

### Day 0: 18 November, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Time Spent: 1h Day1: spent it learning to become better at CSS from freecodecamp, looking at applied visual design! :) Happy 100days of code start #100daysofcode #FreeCodeCamp

**Worked on**: I worked on the applied visual design today, it has shown me a way of matching colours a lot better and how you can make colours compliment each other.

**Thoughts:** I've come to realise that CSS isn't as difficult as it seems it just takes patience and messing around with values to see what fits best for your site
